# Text Mining
# Predict ratings of customers based on their reviews.

Based on the given customer reviews on the products and the reviews of the website about an E – commerce company. We have to predict the rating given by a customer based on the text data written in the review.

## Business Understanding

E-Business companies have their own review and ratings application in their platform. But often, reviews of a product spread across multiple sources like Facebook posts, Tweets, Blogs etc.  Companies can make use of the data available in their platform to train Machine Learning / Deep Learning models and predict ratings for the reviews available in social media platforms. 

Business can utilize these ratings to understand the products reach and customer sentiments on a product. It will help them to improve their marketing strategies, build better products, provide good services.
